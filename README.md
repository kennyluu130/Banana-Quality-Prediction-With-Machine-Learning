# Banana Quality Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project predicts the quality of bananas (good or bad) using machine learning models. By focusing on maximizing precision for good-quality bananas, the project provides a practical approach for applications like sorting and supply chain management.

## Skills & Tools
**Skills:** Data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, visualization, interpretability  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and contains 8,000 banana entries with multiple features describing physical characteristics. It is balanced between high-quality and low-quality bananas and contains no null or duplicate values.

## Installation
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/banana-quality-prediction.git
cd banana-quality-prediction
```
2. Install required Python packages:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook banana_quality_prediction.ipynb
```

Alternatively, the notebook can be run directly in Google Colab.
